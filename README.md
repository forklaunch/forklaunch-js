    <b>TypeScript-first backend framework with incremental adoption, optional static typing, and code-driven architecture.</b>
    <br><br>
    Start new or drop into any TypeScript project. Grow into a fully typed services and workers platform, without lock-in.

## Overview

Most Node backends fall into one of two buckets:

| Approach | Problem |
|---|---|
| Hand-built Express | Boilerplate, scaling friction, infra drift |
| Full-stack frameworks | Faster at the beginning, difficult to escape later, poor infra support |

ForkLaunch gives you a middle path:

- Express ergonomics with type safety and conventions (via Zod or TypeBox)
- Generates services, workers, and libraries in a modular monolith with a single command
- Add infrastructure instantly through simple, ergonomic DI
- Uniform project structure and manifest-driven development
- Typed API contracts that generate SDKs for clients
- Flexible and incremental adoption inside existing Express apps
- Live autogenerated OpanAPI, AsyncAPI and OpenTelemetry metrics, logs, traces

If you do not like it, you can change it. ForkLaunch is designed to stay out of your way.

### Infra platform (coming soon)

A deployment layer that turns application code into production infrastructure configuration.

The goal is to let developers choose their cloud, while ForkLaunch automates:

- Network, storage, secrets, and runtime provisioning
- Workers, queues, cron services, and scaling
- Observability and metrics bootstrapping
- Multi-environment deployment tooling

This will be optional and opt-in. Local-first development continues to work without it.

## Quickstart: Framework

Add/upgrade your first routes:

```ts
import { OpenTelemetryCollector } from '@forklaunch/core/http';
import {
  forklaunchExpress,
  handlers
} from '@forklaunch/express';
import {
  number,
  optional,
  SchemaValidator,
  string,
} from '@forklaunch/validator/zod';

const zodSchemaValidator = SchemaValidator();
const openTelemetryCollector = new OpenTelemetryCollector('test');

const forklaunchApplication = forklaunchExpress(
  zodSchemaValidator,
  openTelemetryCollector
);

// direct instantiation on application/router
forklaunchApplication.get("/get", {
    name: "Simple Get",
    summary: "A simple get request, resembling a health check",
    responses: {
        200: string
    }
}, (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).send("Ok!");
})

const bodySchema = {
    something: number,
    optionalSomething: optional(string)
}

// upgrading an already existing express endpoint with easy wrapper
const expressLikeHelloWorldPost = handlers.post("/post", {
    name: "Simple Post",
    summary: "A simple post request, adding a hello: world to the passed body",
    body: bodySchema,
    responses: {
        200: {
            ...bodySchema,
            hello: string
        }
    }
}, (req, res) => {
    res.status(200).json({
        ...req.body,
        hello: 'world'
    });
})

// optionally register handlers for use with UniversalSdk
forklaunchApplication.registerSdks(..);

// start the server
forklaunchApplication.listen(8000, () => {
    console.log(`Server started on ${8000}!`);
});
```

## CLI quickstart: generate services, workers, and libraries

### Installation

```bash
npm i -g forklaunch
```

### Getting started (drop into new or existing repo)

```bash
forklaunch init app <app_name>
```

### New service

```bash
forklaunch init service <service_name>
```

### New worker

```bash
forklaunch init worker <worker_name>
```

### New shared library

```bash
forklaunch init library <library_name>
```

Each command:

- Adds project files
- Updates the manifest
- Registers build and runtime config
- Ensures consistent structure across all components

Once done, run the following:

```bash
// applies initial migrations and schemas
pnpm/bun database:setup

// alias for docker compose up
pnpm/bun dev
```

Happy hacking!

## Highlights

- Incrementally adoptable inside existing Express apps
- Type driven API definitions with automatic client SDK generation
- Services, workers, and libraries created and wired via CLI with clean and DDD principles
- Built-in primitives for auth, database, and validation
- Designed for real-world monorepo environments
- Infra automation platform coming soon

## Examples

Complete runnable examples live under:

`framework/e2e-tests/servers`

These showcase multi-service applications, typed routing, workers, and real workflows.

## Feedback

ForkLaunch is early and feedback is appreciated.  
Issues, discussions, and contributions are welcome.

The mission is to provide the flexibility of Express with the structure and productivity of a framework, without forcing a rewrite and without hiding the underlying infrastructure.
