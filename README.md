## Overview

ForkLaunch streamlines the development process by automating boilerplate creation and managing dependencies across services, workers, and libraries. 

The **CLI** handles manifest updates, Docker configuration, and ensures consistent development patterns.

The **framework** defines powerful abstractions that supercharge common development patterns, to get you up and running quickly.

The best part? If you don't like it, you can easily change it.
