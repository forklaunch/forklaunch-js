## Overview

ForkLaunch is a TypeScript framework that generates production-ready backend applications by automating boilerplate creation and managing dependencies across services, workers, and libraries.

The **CLI** handles manifest updates, docker/environment management, and ensures consistent development patterns. Soon it will help you deploy with whatever architecture you need.

The **framework** provides database integration, authentication, validation, and other common backend functionality, with maximum type-safety in mind, to get you up and running quickly.

**Incrementally Adoptable**: ForkLaunch works as an Express DSL that seamlessly integrates with your existing Express applications. You can adopt it gradually, starting with a single endpoint and expanding as needed.

**Real Examples**: See [`e2e-tests/servers`](framework/e2e-tests/servers) for complete working examples of ForkLaunch applications in action.

The best part? If you don't like it, you can easily change it.
