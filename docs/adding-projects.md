## Overview

The cornerstone of `ForkLaunch` is its modular project system. This approach:
- Keeps code organized and maintainable
- Reduces cognitive load
- Provides flexibility for infrastructure decisions

## Available Projects

### Core Projects
- **Modules**: Pre-built services/workers/libraries that help you bootstrap your application
- **Services**: Host HTTP APIs and web applications
- **Workers**: Run asynchronous tasks using event-driven architecture
- **Libraries**: Share common code and business logic

### Project Building Blocks
- **Routers**: Add RCSIDES stack to existing services/workers
  - Routes
  - Controllers
  - Services
  - Interfaces
  - Mappers
  - Entities
  - Seeders

### Coming Soon
- **Agents**: Optimized for AI-driven workflows
