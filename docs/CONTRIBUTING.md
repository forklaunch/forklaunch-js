## Our Products

ForkLaunch consists of three main products, each with its own license and development process:

### 1. CLI (AGPL License)

### 2. Blueprint (MIT License)
- Core blueprint functionality
- Located in `blueprint/` directory
- Focus on backwards compatibility

### 3. Framework (MIT License)

## Getting Started

### CLI Development (Rust)
1. Install Rust via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
2. Navigate to `cli/` directory
3. Run `cargo build`
4. Run tests with `cargo test`
5. Run E2E tests with scripts in `test/xxxxxx.sh`

### Blueprint & Framework Development (TypeScript)
1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Build all framework: `pnpm build`
3. Run tests: `pnpm test`

All npm scripts for the Blueprint and Framework are available in the root `package.json`. The CLI has its own Rust-specific tooling in the `cli/` directory.

## Development Workflow

Before any development, review security guidelines in `cli/SECURITY.md`

### CLI Development
1. Make changes in `cli/` directory
2. Format code: `cargo fmt`
3. Run clippy: `cargo clippy`
4. Test: `cargo test`

### Blueprint & Framework Development
1. Make your changes
2. Format and lint: `pnpm format && pnpm lint`
3. Run tests: `pnpm test`
4. For specific package testing: `pnpm test --filter @forklaunch/package-name`
