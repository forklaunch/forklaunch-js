## Overview

This guide provides detailed documentation for ForkLaunch CLI commands. These commands manage application artifacts, deployments, environment variables, and SDK configuration. The CLI is designed to streamline development workflows from local setup to platform deployment.

## Sync Command

The `sync` command synchronizes your application directories with application artifacts. It updates your manifest file based on the current project structure and detects project types, configurations, and metadata.

### Basic Usage

```bash
forklaunch sync <subcommand> [OPTIONS]
```

### Subcommands

#### sync all

Performs a full synchronization of all projects in the modules directory with the manifest.

**Usage:**
```bash
forklaunch sync all [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
| Option | Short | Description |
| :----- | :---- | :---------- |
| `--path <PATH>` | `-p` | Path to application root (optional) |
| `--confirm-all` | `-y` | Skip interactive prompts and confirm all changes |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help information |

**What It Does:**
- Scans the modules directory for all project folders
- Detects project types (service, worker, library, router)
- Identifies orphaned projects (in manifest but not on disk)
- Automatically detects service configurations, database settings, and infrastructure requirements
- Prompts for missing metadata (description, database type, etc.)
- Updates the manifest with detected configurations
- Handles orphaned project cleanup

**Examples:**

Basic sync of all projects:
```bash
forklaunch sync all
```

Sync all projects without interactive prompts:
```bash
forklaunch sync all --confirm-all
```

Sync from a specific path:
```bash
forklaunch sync all --path /path/to/application
```

**Workflow:**
1. Scans modules directory for project folders
2. Compares with existing manifest entries
3. Detects new and removed projects
4. For each project, analyzes configuration files to determine type and settings
5. Prompts for any missing or ambiguous information
6. Updates manifest with new entries and removes orphaned ones
7. Generates necessary configuration files

---

#### sync service

Synchronizes a specific service with artifacts.

**Usage:**
```bash
forklaunch sync service <SERVICE_NAME> [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
| Option | Short | Description |
| :----- | :---- | :---------- |
| `--path <PATH>` | `-p` | Path to application root (optional) |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help information |

**What It Does:**
- Analyzes service directory structure
- Detects HTTP route configurations
- Identifies database requirements
- Determines infrastructure dependencies
- Prompts for service metadata (description, database type)
- Updates service artifacts in manifest

**Examples:**

Sync a single service:
```bash
forklaunch sync service billing
```

Sync service from custom path:
```bash
forklaunch sync service payment --path ./apps
```

**Interactive Prompts:**
- Service description (optional)
- Database type (if database detected)
- Infrastructure configuration (Redis, S3, etc.)

---

#### sync worker

Synchronizes a specific worker with artifacts.

**Usage:**

**What It Does:**
- Analyzes worker directory structure
- Detects worker type (BullMQ, Kafka, Celery, etc.)
- Identifies database and queue dependencies
- Determines infrastructure requirements
- Prompts for worker metadata
- Updates worker artifacts in manifest

**Examples:**

Sync a single worker:
```bash
forklaunch sync worker email-processor
```

Sync worker with custom path:
```bash
forklaunch sync worker notification-handler --path ./modules
```

**Supported Worker Types:**
- BullMQ (Redis-based job queue)
- Kafka (distributed streaming)
- Celery (async task queue)
- Custom workers

---

#### sync library

Synchronizes a specific library with artifacts.

- Prompts for description and metadata

**Examples:**

Sync a single library:
```bash
forklaunch sync library shared-utils
```

Sync library from custom path:
```bash
forklaunch sync library helpers --path ./packages
```

---

### Common Sync Workflows

**Initialize Fresh Application:**
```bash
# After creating a new ForkLaunch application
forklaunch sync all --confirm-all
```

**Add New Service and Sync:**
```bash
# Create service directory with configuration
mkdir -p modules/new-service/src

# Sync to detect and register new service
forklaunch sync service new-service
```

**Detect Service Changes:**
```bash
# After modifying service configuration (adding database, routes, etc.)
forklaunch sync service service-name
```

**Cleanup and Reorganize:**
```bash
# Remove old services and resync manifest
forklaunch sync all
# CLI will detect missing directories and prompt for cleanup
```

---

## Deploy Command

The `deploy` command manages application deployments to AWS infrastructure through the ForkLaunch platform.

### Basic Usage

```bash
forklaunch deploy <subcommand> [OPTIONS]
```

### Subcommands

#### deploy create

Creates a new deployment of your application to a specified environment and region.

**Usage:**
```bash
forklaunch deploy create --release <VERSION> --environment <ENV> --region <REGION> [OPTIONS]
```

**Required Options:**
| Option | Short | Description |
| :----- | :---- | :---------- |
| `--release <VERSION>` | `-r` | Release version to deploy (e.g., v1.0.0) |
| `--environment <ENV>` | `-e` | Environment name (staging, production, etc.) |
| `--region <REGION>` | - | AWS region (us-east-1, eu-west-1, etc.) |

**Optional Options:**
| Option | Short | Description |
| :----- | :---- | :---------- |
| `--distribution-config` | - | Distribution strategy (centralized or distributed) |
| `--path <PATH>` | `-p` | Path to application root |
| `--no-wait` | - | Don't wait for deployment to complete |

**What It Does:**
1. Reads application manifest to get platform integration info
2. Validates application exists on platform
3. Creates deployment request with specified configuration
4. Monitors deployment progress (unless --no-wait is set)
5. Detects missing environment variables and prompts for values
6. Handles environment variable validation based on component metadata
7. Automatically retries after environment variables are provided

**Examples:**

Basic deployment:
```bash
forklaunch deploy create --release v1.0.0 --environment staging --region us-east-1
```

Production deployment:
```bash
forklaunch deploy create -r v1.0.0 -e production --region us-east-1
```

Non-blocking deployment (check status later):
```bash
forklaunch deploy create -r v1.0.0 -e staging --region us-east-1 --no-wait
```

Distributed deployment:
```bash
forklaunch deploy create -r v1.0.0 -e production --region us-east-1 --distribution-config distributed
```

**Interactive Environment Variables:**

When deployment detects missing environment variables:

```
[WARNING] Deployment blocked: Missing required environment variables

[INFO] Missing variables for service 'api':
  Enter value for DATABASE_URL (service:database-connection)
  Enter value for NODE_ENV
```

**Special Handling:**
- `NODE_ENV`: Interactive selection between development/production
- Port variables (ending with `_PORT`): Must be valid port numbers (0-65535)
- Duration variables (ending with `_SECONDS`, `_TIMEOUT`): Must be numeric
- Base64 encoded values: Validates format and length based on component requirements
- Empty values: Not allowed; validation prevents blank submissions

**Environment Variable Scopes:**

Environment variables can be scoped to:
- **Global**: Applied to all services and workers
- **Service-specific**: Applied to specific service
- **Worker-specific**: Applied to specific worker
- **Component property**: Linked to component configuration property

| `--no-wait` | - | Don't wait for destruction to complete |

**What It Does:**
1. Validates application is integrated with platform
2. Creates destruction request with specified mode
3. Monitors destruction progress (unless --no-wait is set)
4. Cleans up AWS resources based on mode

**Destroy Modes:**

```

Destroy with data preservation:
```bash
forklaunch deploy destroy -e staging --region us-east-1 --mode preserve-data
```

Non-blocking destruction:
```bash
forklaunch deploy destroy -e staging --region us-east-1 --no-wait
```

---

### Common Deploy Workflows

**Deploy New Release:**
```bash
# After pushing changes and creating release
forklaunch deploy create --release v1.1.0 --environment staging --region us-east-1

# After testing in staging
forklaunch deploy create --release v1.1.0 --environment production --region us-east-1
```

**Progressive Deployment:**
```bash
# Deploy to staging first
forklaunch deploy create -r v2.0.0 -e staging --region us-east-1

# Run tests in staging...

# Then deploy to production
forklaunch deploy create -r v2.0.0 -e production --region us-east-1
```

**Cleanup Temporary Environment:**

   - Creates VSCode build tasks
   - Updates package.json files with type definitions
4. For live mode:
   - Removes generated configuration files
   - Removes type definitions from package.json
   - Restores development-friendly setup
5. Writes changes (or shows dry run results)

**Examples:**

Switch to generated mode:
```bash
forklaunch sdk mode --type generated
```

Switch to live mode:
```bash
forklaunch sdk mode --type live
```

Preview changes without applying:
```bash
forklaunch sdk mode --type generated --dryrun
```

Running validation first...

Adding 4 missing variables:
  [✓] Added SMTP_PASSWORD to modules/email-worker/.env
  [✓] Added QUEUE_WORKERS to modules/email-worker/.env
  [✓] Added API_KEY to modules/api-service/.env.local
  [✓] Added DEBUG_MODE to .env.local

Sync completed successfully!
```

---

### Environment Variable Hierarchy

Variables are organized in a hierarchy:
1. **Global variables** (root .env.local) - used by all projects
2. **Service-specific** (modules/service-name/.env) - used by specific service
3. **Worker-specific** (modules/worker-name/.env) - used by specific worker
4. **Component properties** (linked to component configuration)

---

### Common Environment Workflows

**Setup New Environment:**
```bash
# Validate what variables are needed
forklaunch environment validate

# Add all missing variables with placeholders
forklaunch environment sync

# Fill in values
nano .env.local
nano modules/api-service/.env
```

**Onboard New Developer:**
```bash
# New developer clones repository
git clone <repo>
cd <app>

# Sync environment variables
forklaunch env sync

# Developer fills in their local values
nano .env.local
```

**Validate Before Deployment:**
```bash
# Check all variables are set before deploying
forklaunch environment validate

# Fix any missing variables
forklaunch environment sync
```

---

## Integrate Command

The `integrate` command links your local application with a ForkLaunch platform application.

### Basic Usage

```bash
forklaunch integrate --app <APP_ID> [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Short | Description |
| :----- | :---- | :---------- |
| `--app <APP_ID>` | `-a` | Platform application ID (required) |
| `--path <PATH>` | `-p` | Path to application root (optional) |
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help information |

### What It Does

1. Validates you are logged in to the ForkLaunch platform
2. Checks that specified application exists on platform
3. Reads local application manifest
4. Updates manifest with platform application and organization IDs
5. Confirms integration and shows next steps

### Examples

Integrate with platform application:
```bash
forklaunch integrate --app app_123abc
```

Integrate from custom path:
```bash
forklaunch integrate --app app_123abc --path ./apps/myapp
```

### Manifest Updates

After integration, your `.forklaunch/manifest.toml` is updated with:

```toml
[application]
platform_application_id = "app_123abc"
platform_organization_id = "org_456def"
```

### Next Steps

After integration, you can:

```bash
# Create releases
forklaunch release create --version v1.0.0

# Deploy to platform
forklaunch deploy create --release v1.0.0 --environment staging --region us-east-1

# Manage deployments through platform UI
```

---

### Common Integration Workflows

**Connect Local App to Platform:**
```bash
# Create application on platform web UI (get APP_ID)

# In local repository
forklaunch integrate --app app_123abc

# Now ready to deploy
forklaunch release create --version v1.0.0
forklaunch deploy create --release v1.0.0 --environment staging --region us-east-1
```

**Link Existing Application:**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repo>
cd <app>

# Get application ID from platform
# Link to platform
forklaunch integrate --app app_xyz789

# Sync projects
forklaunch sync all

# Deploy
forklaunch deploy create --release v1.0.0 --environment staging --region us-east-1
```

---

## Best Practices

### Development Workflow

1. **Initialize and Sync:**
   ```bash
   forklaunch init my-app
   forklaunch sync all
   ```

2. **Add Components:**
   ```bash
   forklaunch add service billing
   forklaunch sync service billing
   ```

3. **Manage Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   forklaunch environment validate
   forklaunch environment sync
   # Fill in values
   ```

4. **Use Live SDK Mode:**
   ```bash
   forklaunch sdk mode --type live
   ```

5. **Test Locally:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Deployment Workflow

1. **Prepare for Deployment:**
   ```bash
   forklaunch integrate --app <APP_ID>
   forklaunch sync all
   forklaunch environment validate
   ```

2. **Create Release:**
   ```bash
   forklaunch release create --version v1.0.0
   ```

3. **Switch to Generated Mode:**
   ```bash
   forklaunch sdk mode --type generated
   ```

4. **Deploy to Staging:**
   ```bash
   forklaunch deploy create --release v1.0.0 --environment staging --region us-east-1
   ```

5. **Test in Staging:**
   ```bash
   # Run integration tests, manual testing
   ```

6. **Deploy to Production:**
   ```bash
   forklaunch deploy create --release v1.0.0 --environment production --region us-east-1
   ```

### Troubleshooting

**Deployment Fails with Missing Environment Variables:**
- Run `forklaunch environment validate`
- Use `forklaunch environment sync` to add missing variables
- Fill in required values and retry deployment

**Service Not Detected in Sync:**
- Ensure service directory exists in modules path
- Check that service has proper configuration files
- Run `forklaunch sync service <name>` with verbose output

**Cannot Integrate with Platform:**
- Verify you are logged in: `forklaunch whoami`
- Confirm application ID is correct
- Check that application exists on platform
