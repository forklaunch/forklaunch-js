# ForkLaunch Skills for Claude Code

Skills that teach Claude Code (and developers) how to build with, and operate, ForkLaunch.

## Agent Behavior (applies to every skill, not just the one you're reading)

**CLI-first, API-fallback — but never blindly retry a mutation.** For anything that talks to the
ForkLaunch control plane — deployments, logs, alerts, infrastructure, issues — try the matching
`fl` command first. If no CLI command covers the action yet, or a **read-only** command fails
(a `GET`/list/status check), falling back to a direct API call is safe — reads have no side
effects to duplicate. If a **mutating** command fails (create, deploy, delete, anything that
changes state), the request may have already been accepted server-side before the CLI itself
failed (a timeout, a dropped connection) — check whether it actually landed first (the matching
`fl ... info`/list/status command) before resubmitting through the API or retrying at all. The CLI
already handles auth (`fl login`) and consistent output for what it covers; a raw API call skips
that, and skips nothing about the risk of a duplicate write.

**Every operation ends with a plain-language summary — not something the user has to ask for.**
Whatever technical work happened above it (commands run, files changed, errors seen), close with
a few short sentences a non-technical person could read and understand: what you were doing, what
happened, and whether it's fixed or still needs their input. No jargon, no unexplained acronyms,
no file paths or stack traces in this part — those already exist above it for anyone who wants
them. If a friend or family member with no coding background read only this last part, they
should be able to tell what happened. If a result is uncertain or partial, say that plainly too —
"I couldn't confirm X" is a better summary than skipping X.

**Keep the CLI and skills in sync.** `forklaunch` self-updates its own binary automatically on
each run (comparing against the version pinned in `manifest.toml`), but the skill pack a project
already has on disk (`.claude/skills/`, `AGENTS.md`, etc.) is a static copy from whenever
`forklaunch context` last ran — it does **not** refresh itself. After a CLI version change, or if
a skill's instructions stop matching what a command actually does (a flag that no longer exists,
an error message that reads differently), re-run `forklaunch context` to pull the current skill
pack before continuing. If a command you were told to run turns out to be missing or renamed,
don't guess at flags — re-sync the skill pack first, since the instructions you have may simply be
stale.

**Check a foundational choice against the goal before committing to it, not after.** Some
decisions are cheap to undo (a formatter, a linter, a variable name) and some aren't (a module
preset, a database engine, an auth provider) — the expensive ones usually mean re-scaffolding and
redeploying to fix, not just editing a file. Before locking in one of the expensive ones: state in
one sentence what capability the app actually needs, then check the specific option against that
sentence rather than against how closely its name matches. Two options can both plausibly "add
auth" or "add a database" while only one actually does what the task needs — see `/cli` for a
concrete example with `iam-base` vs `iam-better-auth`. If getting it wrong would be costly to
undo, say so and confirm with the user before proceeding, the same way you would before an
irreversible deploy action.

## How to explain things (applies to every skill)

Explain results as if to an **intelligent high schooler**: plain language, no
jargon, no undefined acronyms. **Use a concrete example** — abstractions are
where jargon hides, and an example forces you to be specific.

Then the technical detail if it is needed. Then **close with a plain-English
summary**: what changed, what it means, what is still open. Someone who skipped
the middle should read the first and last parts and be correctly informed.

**plain → technical → plain summary.** The order is not optional.

Say what happened rather than what was run; never fake simplicity by dropping
caveats; and always say what you did *not* verify.

## Critical Rules

1. **Import from `@{{app-name}}/core`** for schema primitives, handlers, router, validator. NEVER from `@forklaunch/validator/*` or `@forklaunch/express`.
2. **Schemas use natural notation:** `{ name: string, age: optional(number) }`. NEVER `z.object()`.
3. **Enums use const objects:** `const X = { A: 'a' } as const`. NEVER TypeScript `enum`.
4. **Handler `name` cannot contain slashes.** Use PascalCase: `'GetRestaurant'`.
5. **Handler responses must match `responses[code]`.** Do not return starter `{ message }` JSON against a domain schema.
6. **Controller calls must match service signatures.** Pass the exact command object, not one primitive field, when a service expects `{ ... }`.
7. **Follow the local service shape.** Current Studio scaffolds often use schema-derived DTO services; do not force older mapper/entity-return examples.
8. **Always `em.flush()` after mutations.**
9. **Use `forklaunch init` for structural changes.** Don't manually create service directories.
10. **Don't edit `manifest.toml` by hand.** Use `forklaunch change` commands. Note `change service --to worker` ADDS a worker and KEEPS the HTTP surface — `type = "Worker"` means "has a worker", not "is no longer a service" (see `observability-api`). Never hand-roll a `worker.ts` to avoid it.
11. **Supply ALL CLI flags** or the CLI drops into interactive mode and hangs.
12. **TSC for backend:** `cd src/modules/<service> && ./node_modules/.bin/tsc --noEmit`
13. **Studio watch logs are informational.** `tsx watch` restarts, shutdown spam, force-kill messages, and MaxListeners warnings are not repair targets if the service starts again.

## Studio Architecture Default

In Studio planning, bias toward fat services and workers:

- Start with one custom backend service as the app control plane. Pack synchronous APIs, admin endpoints, domain logic, and shared persistence into that service first.
- If background processing is necessary, generate one worker scaffold instead of a separate service plus worker. A ForkLaunch worker scaffold creates the service/worker pair; use the service side as the control plane and the worker side for jobs. Name the worker the same product/control-plane name you would have used for the service, not a separate queue-specific name.
- Do not split by domain nouns like parser, analytics, notifications, reports, or admin during initial generation. Put future splits in prose or scaling notes, not executable scaffold commands.
- Only add more custom services when loading/importing a repo whose existing deployable boundaries make separation absolutely necessary.
- Never name the custom service or worker `core`, `monitoring`, `client-sdk`, `iam`, or `billing`; those are reserved scaffold modules. Use a product-specific name such as `workspace`, `operations`, `intake`, `reports`, `patients`, or the app domain name.
- Use a two-pass Studio decision flow: ask all user-facing questions in one grouped pass, then do one review pass that locks answers/defaults and proceeds. The first pass may ask as many questions as real requirements need; do not cap it at three or create a third decision turn. In user-facing text, call the main service the `API` or `main API`, never `core API`.
- Studio has no external coding agent handoff. Do not emit copy/paste-to-agent instructions, skill references, or "HOW TO USE THIS PLAN" text in Studio plans.
- Compliance boundary: ForkLaunch-hosted Bedrock model calls are BAA-protected through ForkLaunch; nothing else is. Direct AWS account services, direct Anthropic/OpenAI keys, SendGrid, Stripe, and other processors need the user's own compliance setup.
