# Design Philosophy Router

## How This Works

Every app has a design philosophy, not just an industry. Robinhood and Fidelity are both "fintech" but look nothing alike. Stripe and AWS Console are both "dev tools" but from different planets.

**Step 1:** Identify the philosophy by asking:

> "Which of these feels closest to what you're building?
> 1. **Stripe** - clean developer craft, precision, API-docs-meet-dashboard
> 2. **Linear** - dark, fast, keyboard-driven, engineering-precision
> 3. **Robinhood** - consumer-simple, mobile-first, numbers-as-heroes
> 4. **Fidelity** - institutional authority, data-extreme, conservative
> 5. **Clinical** - healthcare trust, WCAG AAA, calming, accessible
> 6. **Airbnb** - marketplace warmth, photography-driven, discovery
> 7. **Retool** - ops density, max information, zero decoration
> 8. **Notion** - content canvas, typography-first, reading-optimized
>
> Or name a reference brand and I'll match it."

**Step 2:** Apply the matching philosophy below.
**Step 3:** Orchestrate tools (see Tool Stack at the bottom).

If the user names a brand not listed, map it:

| Brand | Philosophy |
|-------|-----------|
| Vercel, Supabase, Neon, Planetscale | Stripe |
| Raycast, Arc, Warp, Fig | Linear |
| Cash App, Venmo, Chime, Monzo | Robinhood |
| Bloomberg, Schwab, E*Trade, banks | Fidelity |
| One Medical, Headspace, MyChart, Calm | Clinical |
| DoorDash, Uber, Etsy, Instacart | Airbnb |
| Django admin, Airplane, internal tools | Retool |
| Substack, Medium, Ghost, Coda | Notion |
| Legora, DocuSign, legal platforms | Fidelity (conservative variant) |

## Universal Bans (All Philosophies)

NEVER use, regardless of philosophy:
- Side-stripe borders (`border-left: 3px solid`) on cards or list items
- Gradient text (`background-clip: text` with gradient)
- Glassmorphism as decoration (blur, glass cards, glow borders)
- Nested cards (cards inside cards)
- Identical repeated card grids (icon + heading + text x12)
- Pure black (#000) or pure white (#fff). Always tint.
- Bounce or elastic easing
- Purple-to-blue gradients, cyan-on-dark, neon accents (the "AI palette")
- Monospace as lazy "technical" shorthand
- Overused fonts: Inter, DM Sans, Space Grotesk, Plus Jakarta Sans, Instrument Sans, Outfit, Syne

## Philosophy 1: Stripe (Developer Craft)

**References:** Stripe, Vercel, Supabase, Neon, Planetscale
**Emotional register:** Craft, precision, quiet confidence
**User:** Developers and technical product managers

### Typography
- **Display:** Whyte, GT America, or Untitled Sans (geometric with subtle personality)
- **Body:** Same family, lighter weight. One family throughout.
- **Monospace:** Jetbrains Mono or Berkeley Mono (for code, API keys, IDs)
- **Scale:** 1.2 ratio. Clean, not cramped.

### Color
- **Theme:** Light mode default, dark mode polished. Both must be first-class.
- **Surface:** Warm gray, barely tinted toward brand hue (oklch 97% L, 0.005 C)
- **Accent:** Indigo or violet. One accent color used sparingly.
- **Borders:** Extremely subtle (oklch 90% L). Define space without shouting.
- **Code blocks:** Slightly tinted background, not pure gray.

### Layout
- **Top nav + sidebar hybrid.** Clean horizontal nav, contextual sidebar for deep pages.
- **Card-based metric displays.** Number, trend indicator, sparkline. No labels longer than 2 words.
- **API docs integration.** Code samples live next to prose. Three-column layout for API reference.
- **Generous padding.** Breathes more than Linear, less than Airbnb.
- **Rounded corners:** 8-12px. Soft but not bubbly.

### Components
- Metric cards: number, delta arrow, sparkline
- Tabbed interfaces for related views
- Inline code with subtle background tint
- Toast notifications (never modals for confirmations)
- Themable components (user can match their brand)

### Motion
- 150ms transitions. Snappy, not flashy.
- No page transitions. Instant routing.
- Subtle hover states (background tint, not border changes)

---

## Philosophy 2: Linear (Precision Engineering)

**References:** Linear, Raycast, Arc, Warp
**Emotional register:** Speed, precision, opinionated
**User:** Engineering teams, power users

### Typography
- **Display:** Inter Tight or Geist (exception to the ban list: Linear earned it)

- **Surface:** Near-black with cool blue-gray tint (oklch 13% L, 0.01 C, hue 260)
- **Accent:** Purple or blue-violet. Gradient sphere for logo/hero moments ONLY (never on text or UI elements).
- **Borders:** oklch 20-25% L. Subtle grid lines.
- **Status colors:** Muted, never saturated. Status is conveyed by label + icon, not color alone.

### Layout
- **Sidebar (collapsible) + main content.** Sidebar is icon-only when collapsed.
- **Keyboard-first navigation.** Every action has a shortcut. Cmd+K command palette required.
- **List views over card views.** Dense, scannable, sortable.
- **Split view for detail.** Click an item, detail panel slides in.
- **No hero sections.** Content starts immediately.

### Components
- Command palette (Cmd+K) with fuzzy search
- List items with inline status, assignee avatar, priority icon
- Keyboard shortcut hints in tooltips and menus
- Context menus (right-click) on every actionable item
- Compact date pickers, inline editing
- Breadcrumbs with scope indicators

### Motion
- 100ms transitions. Everything feels instant.

## Mixing Philosophies

Users can combine: "Stripe craft with Robinhood's mobile-first approach" is valid. When mixing:

1. Pick the PRIMARY philosophy for overall structure and typography.
2. Pick the SECONDARY for specific component patterns or interaction style.
3. Never mix more than two. Three philosophies create incoherence.
4. When in conflict, the primary wins on layout and typography, secondary wins on motion and interaction patterns.

---

## Tool Orchestration

Install these design tools once:

```bash
npx skills add anthropics/frontend-design    # Base: anti-generic aesthetics
npx skills add pbakaus/impeccable            # Execution: teach/craft/extract
npx skills add shadcn-ui/ui                  # Components: React + Tailwind
npx skills add nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max-skill  # Reference: 161 palettes, 57 font pairings
npx skills add chrisvoncsefalvay/claude-d3js-skill   # Data viz: D3.js
npx skills add hamen/material-3-skill        # Android/Flutter: Material 3
```

### Workflow

1. **Context:** Run `/impeccable teach` with the selected philosophy's traits as design context.
2. **Components:** `npx shadcn@latest init` if React. Add components as needed.
3. **Palette:** Reference UI/UX Pro Max for font pairing inspiration. Apply philosophy-specific rules.
4. **Build:** Use `/impeccable craft` for the shape-then-build workflow.
5. **Audit:** Check against the philosophy's rules. Run `/impeccable extract` for design tokens.

### The Test

After building, ask: "If someone saw this and I said 'an AI made it,' would they believe it instantly?" If yes, you used defaults. Go back and make intentional choices. A designed interface makes people ask "how was this made?" not "which AI made this?"

Sources: [impeccable.style](https://impeccable.style/), [Stripe Dashboard](https://docs.stripe.com/stripe-apps/design), [Linear Method](https://linear.app/method/introduction), [Robinhood Design](https://robinhood.com/us/en/newsroom/the-top-secret-robinhood-design-story/)

## Production Polish Bar (Replit/Lovable caliber — NON-NEGOTIABLE)

A chosen philosophy is not enough; execution is what separates "beautiful" from "an AI made it."
Every generated screen must clear ALL of these before it's considered done:

**Type scale** — never one size everywhere. A real scale: page title (2xl–3xl, tight tracking,
semibold+), section headings (lg–xl), body (sm–base, relaxed leading), meta/labels (xs, muted,
often uppercase tracking-wide). Numbers that matter are the biggest thing on the screen.

**Spacing rhythm** — a consistent 4/8px system. Generous whitespace; let content breathe. Align
everything to a grid — nothing one pixel off. Group related items tight, separate groups with air.

**Color discipline** — ONE accent, used sparingly for the primary action + key data. Everything else
is surface/text/border tokens. Never a wall of default Tailwind grays; use the studio design tokens.
Semantic colors (success/warn/danger) only for state, never decoration.

**Depth & surfaces** — layered surfaces (bg → card → elevated), each separated by a subtle border
AND/OR soft shadow. No flat gray boxes floating on flat gray. Cards have real radius (consistent
across the app) and hairline borders.

**Hierarchy** — exactly one primary action per screen (filled accent button); everything else is
secondary (ghost/outline) or tertiary (text). The eye should land on the most important thing first.

**Every state designed** — loading = skeletons (never a bare spinner on a blank page); empty =
a centered illustration/icon + one-line explanation + a CTA (never "No data"); error = inline,
actionable. Interactive elements have hover, active, AND focus-visible styles.

**Motion** — subtle, fast (120–180ms ease-out) transitions on hover/appear. Nothing bounces or
lingers. Respect prefers-reduced-motion.

**Craft details** — tabular-nums for aligned numbers; truncation with title on overflow; icons
optically aligned to text; consistent icon size; responsive (works at 375px and 1440px); real
copy, not lorem/placeholder.

**The test (run it):** "If I said an AI built this, would people believe it instantly?" If yes,
you used defaults — go back and make intentional choices. Aim for "how was this made?"
