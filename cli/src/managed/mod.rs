             A TEMPLATE is an app your organization publishes once — a git repository plus a\n\
             series of published versions. An INSTANCE is one running copy of a template,\n\
             provisioned for a single end customer, with its own deployment and its own\n\
             one-time claim link that hands ownership to that customer.\n\n\
             The usual order is:\n\
             \x20 1. template create            register the template (it starts as a DRAFT)\n\
             \x20 2. template publish           add a version, pinning a semver to a git ref\n\
             \x20 3. template publish-template  flip the template itself to PUBLISHED\n\
             \x20 4. instance create            launch a copy for one customer\n\
             \x20 5. instance claim-link        reveal the one-time link, hand it to them\n\n\
             Steps 2 and 3 are both required and are NOT the same thing — see\n\
             `forklaunch managed template --help`.\n\n\
             All of these commands talk to the ForkLaunch control plane (platform-management),\n\
             never to the managed-apps service directly. Run `forklaunch login` first — the\n\
             one exception is `instance claim`, which is the customer-facing command and\n\
             needs no ForkLaunch account at all.",
