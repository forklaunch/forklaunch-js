## Overview

This project was generated by ForkLaunch. ForkLaunch streamlines the development process by automating boilerplate creation and managing dependencies across services, workers, and libraries. It handles manifest updates, Docker configuration, and ensures consistent development patterns.

## Getting Started

This creates a new project with the basic structure including:
- ForkLaunch manifest file
- Docker Compose configuration
- Basic project structure
- Development environment setup
- Pre-configured ESLint, Prettier, and Husky

On first run, you'll need to run the following commands (also captured in `setup.sh`):

```bash
{{#is_node}}pnpm{{/is_node}}{{^is_bun}}bun{{/is_bun}} install
{{#is_node}}pnpm{{/is_node}}{{^is_bun}}bun run {{/is_bun}}build
{{#is_node}}pnpm{{/is_node}}{{^is_bun}}bun {{/is_bun}}migrate:init
{{#is_node}}pnpm{{/is_node}}{{^is_bun}}bun {{/is_bun}}dev
```

## Core Commands

### Adding Components

#### Add a Service

```bash
forklaunch add service my-service
```

Creates a new microservice with:
- Service boilerplate code, including models, controllers, services, and routes
- Updated manifest
- Docker Compose configuration
- All necessary dependencies

#### Add a Worker

```bash
forklaunch add worker my-worker
```

Creates a background worker with:
- Worker boilerplate code, including models, controllers, services, and routes
- Job processing setup
- Updated manifest and Docker configuration

#### Add a Library

```bash
forklaunch add library my-library
```

Creates a shared library that can be used across services:
- Library structure
- Package configuration
- Automatic dependency linking

### Router Management

```bash
forklaunch add router my-controller
```

The `add router` command is particularly powerful as it:
- Creates a new Controller following MVC patterns
- Automatically wires up routes, in code
- Integrates with existing service or worker
- Generates test files for the new controller

## Database Migrations

ForkLaunch uses MikroORM for database management with these commands:

```bash
# Initialize the database
pnpm migrate:init

# Create a new migration
pnpm migrate:create

# Apply pending migrations
pnpm migrate:up

# Revert the last migration
pnpm migrate:down
```

To access the full MikroORM CLI, run `pnpm mikro-orm`. Note, you may have to supply necessary ENV arguments to interface correctly with the target database.

## Development Workflow

### Starting the Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This starts all services and workers defined in your manifest.

### Building the Project

```bash
pnpm build
```

Compiles all services, workers, and libraries.

## Development Tools

### Code Quality

ForkLaunch comes with pre-configured:
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- Husky for Git hooks

### Git Integration

To enable Husky Git hooks:

```bash
npx husky install
```

This sets up pre-commit hooks for linting and formatting.

### Testing

Run tests with:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Advanced Configuration

### OpenTelemetry Configuration

By default, ForkLaunch will configure OpenTelemetry to send traces to an OpenTelemetry collector service running in docker. The LGTM stack is pre-configured to receive metrics, logs, and traces, and a pre-configured `grafana` dashboard is available at `http://localhost:3000`.

In order to make adjustments, config and code is located in the `monitoring` directory. Custom metrics can be added to `monitoring/metrics.ts`, and used virtually anywhere in code. Context aware instrumentation will deliver logs, metrics and traces. Supported override ENV variables are:

- `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` - The endpoint to send traces to.
- `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` - The name of the service.

### OpenAPI Configuration and API Reference documentation

Contract aware OpenAPI is generated live when running `pnpm dev`. API references are available at `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/docs`. You have the option of using swagger or scalar. If using scalar (by default), customization options can be passed through additional configuration. Note, the path can be overridden by supplying values for the following ENV variables:

- `VERSION` - The title of the OpenAPI documentation.
- `DOCS_PATH` - The path to the OpenAPI documentation.

Enrichment of the OpenAPI spec can be done inline where contract details are defined.

### Custom License

When initializing a project, the license was specified. The generated license will appear in the root of your project.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter service specific issues, you can run `dev:local` within any service or worker to start a local development server. Please note, you will need docker resources to be run in order to interact with specified resources.

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed: `pnpm install`
2. Rebuild the project: `pnpm build`
3. Check Docker services: `docker-compose ps`
4. Review logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
